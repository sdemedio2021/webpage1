    	    	<!--biography-->
    	      <p>Hedy Lamarr was born in 1914 in Vienna, Austria. Her name at the time was Hedwig
	      		Eva Maria Kiesler. In the late 1920's she was discovered as an actress and 
	      		moved to Berlin. She later moved back to Vienna and pursued an acting career
	      		in many stage roles. In 1937, she went to Paris and met Louis B Mayer, who 
	      		was scouting talent in Europe. He covinced her to change her name to Hedy 
	      		Lamar and then brought her to Hollywood in 1938. She was known as "The Worlds
	      		Most Beautiful Woman."</p> 
	      		
	      <p>In her spare time, Hedy worked on different hobbies and inventions. Some of these
	      		inventions included an improved traffic light and a tablet that when put in water, 
	      		dissovles and makes the drink carbonated. Not many people knew about her inventions 
	      		at the time. During World War II, she learned that radio controlled torpedos could be
	      		easily jammed, which caused the torpedo to go off course. She thought of creating
	      		a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed. She was granted
	      		a patent for her invention in 1942 </p></main>
